# Project Guidelines

- Always use `uv` to manage Python projects, including dependency installation, environment management, and running scripts.
- Only modify Markdown (.md) files outside the `website/` directory. Use `main.py` to synchronize changes to the `website/docs/` folder. Never manually modify the same files in both locations.
