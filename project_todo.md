# Project Status: Soloman Mystery Game - "The Judgment of Atlas"

This document tracks the progress of the murder mystery game design.

## Phase 1: Narrative & Characters (The Core)
*Goal: Complete all character scripts and the core narrative arc.*

- [x] **Core Game Outline** (`game_outline.md`)
    - *Completed. Defines the 2-Act structure, the Virtual/Reality twist, and the true ending.*
- [x] **DM Manual - Core Logic** (`dm_manual.md`)
    - *Completed. Explains the truth to the host, including the twist mechanism.*
- [x] **Character Script: Adrian** (`characters/adrian.md`)
    - *Completed. The "Knife" user. Defined Act 1 (Virtual Accomplice) & Act 2 (Reality Suspect).*
- [x] **Character Script: Simon** (`characters/simon.md`)
    - *Completed. The "Awakened". Defined his role as the anomaly detector.*
- [x] **Character Script: Zach** (`characters/zach.md`)
    - *Completed. The "Real Killer". Defined his Act 1 "AFK" trick and Act 2 cover-up.*
- [x] **Character Script: Alex** (`characters/alex.md`)
    - *Crucial. The "Virtual Killer". Needs to believe he killed his father in Act 1. Needs strong psychological conflict in Act 2 (Did I do it? No, he was dead already).*
- [x] **Character Script: Joe** (`characters/joe.md`)
    - *The "Schemer". Needs detailed interactions for Act 1 (giving the knife to Adrian) and his Act 2 defense against Simon/Zach.*
- [x] **Character Script: Babara** (`characters/babara.md`)
    - *The "Mother". Needs the backstory of the poison (attempted murder in Virtual) and her reaction to the real death.*
- [x] **Character Script: Nathan** (`characters/nathan.md`)
    - *The "Witness". Represents the old conscience of the company. Needs to reveal the "GIFT Track" backstory through his personal logs.*
- [x] **Character Script: Investigator** (`characters/investigator.md`)
    - *Optional/Function. If used, needs a guide on how to facilitate the "System" role or be a player proxy.*

## Phase 2: Game Mechanics & Assets (The Engine)
*Goal: Define how the game is played, ensuring players know what to do.*

- [x] **Clue List - Basic** (`clues_list.md`)
    - *Drafted. Contains the list of evidence.*
- [x] **Clue Cards - Detailed Flavor Text** (`dm/clue_cards.md`)
    - *Task: Convert the dry list into immersive descriptions. (e.g., instead of "Poison found", write "A small vial with crystalline residue... smells like bitter almonds.")*
    - *Task: Split clues clearly into "Virtual Set" and "Reality Set".*
- [x] **Atlas System Scripts** (`dm/atlas_scripts.md`)
    - *Task: Write the specific lines for the AI/DM to read. Includes: Opening Welcome, The "Glitch" warnings, The "Test Complete" reveal (The Twist), and The Final Verdict.*
- [x] **Player Rulebook** (`game/player_rules.md`)
    - *Task: A short guide for players. Explains: Action Points (AP), Discussion Rules (Public vs Private), Voting criteria.*
- [x] **DM Timeline Master Sheet** (`dm/timeline_master.md`)
    - *Task: A side-by-side comparison of "Real Time" vs "Virtual Time" events to help the DM manage the 20-minute murder window.*

## Phase 3: World Building & Logic Check (The Polish)
*Goal: Ensure consistency and immersion.*

- [x] **Map Design Concept** (`game/map_concept.md`)
    - *Task: Describe the layout of the "Office" (Virtual) and the "Conference Room/Medical Bay" (Reality). Crucial for understanding movement and alibis.*
- [x] **Consistency Audit**
    - *Task: Check that timestamps in all character scripts match the DM Timeline. (e.g., If Zach kills at 20:15, is everyone else definitely 'asleep'?)*
    - *Result: Fixed Nathan's timestamp from 20:45 to 20:20 to match the Master Timeline.*

## Phase 4: Production (Ready to Print)
*Goal: Final formatting for players.*

- [ ] **Generate PDF/Markdown artifacts** for each player.
- [ ] **Final Playthrough Simulation** (Mental Walkthrough).
